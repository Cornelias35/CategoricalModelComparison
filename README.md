# CategoricalModelComparison

## In Penguins.ipynb, I have compared Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithms with each other.

### The data that I have work is pengins.csv that comes with seaborn dataset.

## The goal is given predictors, finding penguins species. Different algorithms gave different results and I show them with classification report and confusion matrix.

## With this comparison, I showed that different algorithms perform different that generally based on data.
